            "In the present work, we propose a method for disseminating recommendations epidemically in combination with an on-device fltering process for which we proposed a mobile software architecture in [5] . The most similar work is that of Barbosa et al. [25] that propose device-to-device raw profle exchanges in an opportunistic networking scenario. Yet, it difers in that they neither address scalability nor privacy issues. Other related work subsumes: Information Dissemination: Technical works on device-to-device information exchange in proximity are key enablers for collaboratively built recommender systems on mobile devices. The Haggle API [24] implements data-centric message forwarding using Bluetooth, Ethernet, and WiFi 1 . In [26] , the authors implement a Bluetooth-based middleware to create opportunistic networks between passing users. On top of such enablers, the authors in [7] leverage real-world social phenomena such as large crowds at sports events for event-based mobile communication.\n",

            "In Singhal's taxonomy [21], the mutual exclusion protocol we present is a \"Maekawa-type\" protocol, following [12] . In this class of protocols, a process pi requests permission to enter the critical section from a set Qi of processes, such that Qi f l Qj # 8 for all i, j . Each process in a request set Qi grants exclusive access to the critical section until it is exited, and pi is allowed to enter the critical section only if all processes in Qi grant pi access. Due to the intersection property of request sets and exclusive locking at each process in a request set, only one process can be in the critical section at any time. Also due to these properties, however, Maekawa-type algorithms are generally prone to deadlock and consequently require extra messages to 'detect and recover from deadlocks. Deadlock-free Maekawa-type protocols, such as [ 10,201, have been proposed by strengthening the constraints on request sets so that for all i , j , eitherpi E Qj o r p j E Qi [21]. However, in our context, this strengthening is not possible because the clients requesting mutual exclusion are distinct from the servers that comprise the request sets. Clients cannot be added to reque., qt sets because they are transient and because the population of clients that might contend is not known a priori. The protocol that we present here works with Maekawa's original (weaker) intersection property Qi n Q j # 8 in the fault model addressed in [12]. At the same time, our protocol is not prone to deadlock.\n",

In this section we want to shortly analyze some of these methods in order to motivate our choice to work within an existing probabilistic model for learning taxonomies. We also review the more traditional models for super-vised and unsupervised feature selection.\n",

First, we show that k may be taken to be 1; hence h(w) is α k -substitutive for every k ∈ N. Second, we show that Durand's result also holds for non-erasing transductions.\n",
